# Creating NFT gallery with JS and Tailwind CSS
This project is created as a part of Road to Web3 programme and based on [this documentation](https://docs.alchemy.com/alchemy/road-to-web3/weekly-learning-challenges/4.-how-to-create-an-nft-gallery). 

The API key is needed for this application and it should be added inside the ***baseURL***. Altough there is an API key uploaded in this project, it won't be working for you. You should add your own key in the URL like this: `https://eth-mainnet.alchemyapi.io/v2/${api_key}/getNFTs/`;


## Deploy your own

Deploy the example using [Vercel](https://vercel.com?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=next-example) or preview live with [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/github/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-tailwindcss)
