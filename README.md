# Creating NFT gallery with JS and Tailwind CSS
This project is created as a part of Road to Web3 programme and based on [this documentation](https://docs.alchemy.com/alchemy/road-to-web3/weekly-learning-challenges/4.-how-to-create-an-nft-gallery). 

The API key is needed for this application and it should be added inside the ***baseURL***. You should add your own key in the URL like this: `https://eth-mainnet.alchemyapi.io/v2/${api_key}/getNFTs/`;
